I moved to the United States in 2003 after living in Durban, South Africa for 8 years. I spent my youth in South Carolina attending school. While there, I spent my highschool years working at a movie theater building customer service experience. After highschool, I started working at Amazon Warehouses while I searched for direction in my life. In 2017, I entered the United States Marine Corps, which I would serve in for 5 years. In the military I lived in several different states, from North Carolina, all the way to California. The military gave me the experience and the discipline I needed to move forward in my life. With my newfound skills and hardened mind, I am now attending college at Western Washinginton University in Bellingham,WA; where I am aiming to major in computer science.</p></div>

        <div class="content-left"><h2>The Present</h2> <p> Currently I just moved to Bellingham,WA in September of 2022 in order to attend Western Washington University. I am planning on staying in the area until I at least get a bachelors in computer science. I currently live downtown and work at Bellingham International Airport, although I am interested in jobs more in the field that I am planning on working in in the future. I am 26 years old, and just left the military in September of 2022 as well. I have a 25 year old sister, and a 24 year old brother. My sister lives in Florida, and my brother lives in South Carolina. My mother also lives in South Carolina. I am interested in several hobbies. Motorcycles, kayaking, cars, and computers are my favorite things to play around with. In the military my job was tech heavy so I gained some relevant knowledge with handling switches, routers, servers, and repairing cables, radios, and other eletrical equipment.  </p><a href="contact.html">CONTACT ME </a></div></div>

        <div class="content-right"><h2>The Future</h2> <p> For the foreseeable future, I am planning on achieving a masters in computer science and striving for a minor in math. With that I would like to work in software development in the future. I would like to move to somewhere in the southwest if possible, however I understand that some jobs will require certain locations I will need to be at. Luckily, I am on the west coast now so moving will not be too much of a hassle. For now I am looking at internships and jobs in the greater Seattle area, especially remote jobs to cut down on time spent traveling back and forth. Eventually, I would also like to learn more about cybersecurity and branch out that way in terms of certifications and skillsets.  </p></div>
